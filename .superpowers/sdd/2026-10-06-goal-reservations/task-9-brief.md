# Binding global constraints
- Target the existing Next.js 14.1.0, React 18, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, SWR, Tailwind, and Radix Dialog stack.
- Use PostgreSQL exact decimal arithmetic and decimal strings at new money API boundaries; PHP amounts have two decimal places.
- No new runtime dependency is needed for the reservation model.
- Preserve actual wallet balances and net worth when reserving, releasing, or moving reservations within a wallet.
- Record actual expenses and transfers once; goal allocation events must never become duplicate financial transactions.
- Persist financial mutations atomically and authorize them with `auth.uid()` in the database.
- Require confirmation before an ordinary expense or outgoing transfer releases any goal reservation.
- Preserve existing wallet tiles, ordering, ledger toggle, debt filters, and preview calculations.
- Keep Manrope/Bricolage, restrained emerald emphasis, and Goals summary presentation; ENERGY 1 / RHYTHM 2 / MOTION 1.
- Support light/dark themes, keyboard use, reduced motion, and 375px, 768px, and 1280px layouts.
- Preserve existing history; never automatically reinterpret legacy goal tags as reservations or spending.
- Merging and deployment are separate from implementing and verifying this plan.


# Shared interfaces
Create `src/lib/goals/contracts.ts` for domain types and Zod parsing. Money in these new interfaces is a canonical two-decimal string, not an unchecked JavaScript float. `src/lib/goals/summary.ts` contains pure amount/projection calculations. `src/lib/goals/client.ts` owns RPC transport, request IDs, and structured errors. Keep rendering in components and mutations in this adapter.

```ts
type Money = string; // canonical decimal, e.g. "5000.00"
type GoalStatus = "active" | "completed" | "cancelled";
type ReviewState = "needs_review" | "confirmed";
type ReleaseLine = { goalId: string; accountId: string; amount: Money };
type ReservationMove = { goalId: string; amount: Money };
type LeftoverChoice = { mode: "release" } | { mode: "move"; goalId: string };

type TransactionDraft = {
  type: "income" | "expense" | "transfer";
  accountId: string;
  transferToAccountId: string | null;
  categoryId: string | null;
  goalId: string | null;
  amount: Money;
  description: string | null;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD
  installments: { count: number } | null;
  reservationMoves: ReservationMove[];
};

type FinancialCommand =
  | { kind: "reserve" | "release"; goalId: string; accountId: string; amount: Money }
  | { kind: "reallocate"; goalId: string; destinationGoalId: string; accountId: string; amount: Money }
  | { kind: "close"; goalId: string; status: "completed" | "cancelled"; leftovers: LeftoverChoice | null }
  | { kind: "reopen" | "archive"; goalId: string }
  | { kind: "transaction"; draft: TransactionDraft }
  | { kind: "delete_transaction"; transactionId: string }
  | { kind: "adopt_legacy"; goalId: string; status: GoalStatus;
      reservations: { accountId: string; amount: Money }[]; spentTransactionIds: string[] };

type TransactionQuote = {
  fingerprint: string;
  actual: Money;
  reserved: Money;
  available: Money;
  releases: ReleaseLine[];
};
type FinancialResult = { operationId: string; transactionIds: string[]; replayed: boolean };
type WalletFunds = { accountId: string; actual: Money; reserved: Money; available: Money };
type GoalTotals = {
  goalId: string; reserved: Money; spent: Money; progressAmount: Money;
  remaining: Money; progressPercent: number;
  walletReservations: { accountId: string; amount: Money }[];
  legacyTaggedAmount: Money | null;
};
type GoalFinanceGoal = Omit<Goal, "target_amount" | "current_amount" | "allocation_per_cycle"> &
  { target_amount: Money; current_amount: Money; allocation_per_cycle: Money } & GoalTotals;
type GoalFinanceSnapshot = { goals: GoalFinanceGoal[]; wallets: WalletFunds[] };
```

`Goal` gains `status`, `review_state`, `completed_at`, and `archived_at` in database types. Domain JSON uses the camelCase names above; existing Goal row fields retain their existing snake_case names. Do not rename unrelated database fields.

Public SQL RPCs, all scoped by `auth.uid()`:

- `goal_finance_snapshot() -> jsonb` returns `GoalFinanceSnapshot`, including explicit decimal strings.
- `goal_transaction_quote(p_draft jsonb, p_releases jsonb default null) -> jsonb` returns `TransactionQuote`; null releases requests the proposed default, supplied releases request an exact valid alternative.
- `goal_finance_apply(p_request_id uuid, p_command jsonb, p_quote jsonb default null) -> jsonb` returns `FinancialResult`. A transaction requires a fresh quote even when releases are empty. Other commands reject non-null quotes.

Client exports:

- `fetchGoalFinance(): Promise<GoalFinanceSnapshot>`
- `quoteTransaction(draft: TransactionDraft, releases?: ReleaseLine[]): Promise<TransactionQuote>`
- `applyFinancialCommand(requestId: string, command: FinancialCommand, quote?: TransactionQuote): Promise<FinancialResult>`
- `parseMoney(input: string): Money`, `toMinorUnits(amount: Money): number`, `fromMinorUnits(cents: number): Money`
- `summarizeGoal(goalId: string, target: Money, events: AllocationEvent[]): GoalTotals`

Define `AllocationEvent` from the new database row, including `reserved_delta`, `spent_delta`, goal/account IDs, kind, operation ID, transaction ID, and reversal ID. Fail invalid values rather than coercing them to zero. Map SQL failures into named errors: `INSUFFICIENT_ACTUAL`, `INSUFFICIENT_AVAILABLE`, `INSUFFICIENT_RESERVATION`, `STALE_QUOTE`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`, `INVALID_STATE`, `REQUEST_CONFLICT`, and `NOT_ALLOWED`.


## Task 9: Wallet and dashboard balances remain truthful

**Files:** modify `src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/page.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/hooks/use-data.ts`, `src/components/ui/financial-summary.tsx`; create `tests/wallet-reservations.test.tsx`.

**Interfaces:** consume `WalletFunds` using the same wallet inclusion scope as the existing balance headline. Dashboard's existing metrics continue to consume real transactions and accounts. Local wallet state must refresh after finance operations, using the shared snapshot or explicit revalidation rather than only modal close.

- [ ] Write assertions: reserving 5,000 of 30,000 shows actual 30,000 / reserved 5,000 / available 25,000 and unchanged net worth; excluded wallets remain excluded from corresponding headline sums; credit debt is separate and cannot be reserved; release changes no income/expense metric.
- [ ] Test loading/error states never display fabricated zero balances. Test wallet fetches do not call balance updates, and successful finance operations refresh Wallets while its page remains mounted. Debt filters and previews yield the same values as baseline fixtures.

  Pin `reservations do not change net worth`: `expect(after.netWorth).toBe(before.netWorth)` and `expect(after.available).toBe("25000.00")` after reserving 5,000 in a 30,000 wallet.
- [ ] Run `npx vitest run tests/wallet-reservations.test.tsx`; expect red. Extend the existing Goals-style top summary with the reservation distinction and remove fetch-time credit balance synchronization. Do not redesign lower tiles or change drag order, ledger toggle, wallet actions, or APY/net-worth behavior.
- [ ] Audit credit opening-balance and transaction-derived differences before cutover and document them in the rollout checklist; preserve stored actual debt rather than overwriting it on page load. Preserve existing real cash-advance and payment reporting fixtures.
- [ ] Run focused tests and TypeScript; commit: `feat: show wallet reserved and available funds consistently`.
